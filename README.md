# How it works

You build a project -> launch it -> the game welcomes you, no additional input data is needed. 

If you want to use your image to assemble a puzzle, replace one of the images in the app/images/puzzles folder with the same name with it.

# Requirements

* Installed SDL2 lib
* Installed C++ compiler

# Quick start

Link the SDL2 library and build the project

# Structure

Project have 4 main folders:

* üíª app - main folder, containing:
	* A file with game statistics and the best results
	* Other folders
* ‚úè fonts - folder with fonts
* üñº images - folder with images, containing:

## Class Game

The class is responsible for the gameplay. Methods of this class draw a board for assembling a puzzle, cut the original image into puzzle pieces, display them in random order on the sidebar, create a timer that marks the time of assembling the puzzle. Inherited from the "Graphics" class. It is a visual class.

## Class Texture

## Class Graphics

It is the base class for all visible graphic elements. The class consists of the following fields: a pointer to a texture for caching data, a Rect structure containing the definition of a rectangle (x, y coordinates of the upper left point, width and height), as well as a font. The initial initialization of texture coordinates is performed in the constructor.

## Class MainWindow

The class is responsible for monitoring game states.
The following states are defined in the class:
* MainMenuStatus (Menu)
* GameStatus (Game)
* RuleStatus (Rules)

The constructor performs initial initialization (initial state "MainMenuStatus"). The class contains the "Execution" method ‚Äì it is responsible for event handling and monitoring the current state. This method contains several blocks for checking events: cursor movement and mouse button pressing. Depending on the existing state, the corresponding surfaces are displayed. The general types of states are formed by overlapping surfaces of different classes. At this stage, the menu is available to the user. There are three items in the menu: "Game", "Background information", "Exit".

When selecting the first menu item, the user enters the "GameStatus" state.

When viewing the reference information, the state is considered equal to "RuleStatus".

By selecting the "Exit" option, the program is terminated.
